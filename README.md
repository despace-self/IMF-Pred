# IMF-Pred
Just wrapped up an exciting project predicting interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) test results using a neural network model!

The model achieved impressive performance:
Test R-squared: 0.9805
Test Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 35.09

This project utilized the OMNI2 data set, which includes hourly mean values of IMF and solar wind plasma parameters measured near Earthâ€™s orbit. It also incorporates geomagnetic and solar activity indices, as well as energetic proton fluxes. OMNI2 has been an essential resource for understanding space weather, created at NSSDC in 2003 as a successor to the original OMNI dataset from the 1970s.

Visualized below is the mutual information figure, which highlights the feature importance used in training the model.
